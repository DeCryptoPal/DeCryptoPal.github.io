# ðŸ’¹ Introducing SatsFunds

## ðŸ§± Micro SatsFunds

The Treasury Wallet transfers all Inscriptions revenue to a publicly identified address controlled by the SatsFund team on a weekly basis. \
\
Once the fund reaches 5 BTC, it is considered "closed" and ready for investment. If less than 5 BTC is collected in taxes on a given day, the next day's taxes will be used to reach the requirement. (Note: This 5 BTC limit may be adjusted by the SatsFund team as deemed necessary to create larger or smaller funds)\
\
The funds are then assigned unique characteristics, which make each one distinct. The selection criteria for each fund includes:

* Is it a Blue chip Ordinal or other Inscriptions project?
* Is it a project with a low FP like 0.01  or above 2-3 BTC?
* Are the Inscriptionomics good enough to ape-in?
* Is there any known founder/team member in the project?
* Are the inscriptions being considered art or utility?
* If art project, what is the theme/meta?
* If utility project, what is the utility?

Now, this is where AI comes into play in determining which aspects to consider for each fund. Additionally, all funds must comply with the investment requirements outlined in the previous chapter.

## ðŸ›  How this creates Value

After the initial investments of 5 BTC in each SatsFund are fully recouped, the profit (calculated as the difference between the remaining balance and the initial balance) plus 50% of the funds raised from the initial balance will be distributed to the holders of our Inscriptions directly in sats.\
\
Any remaining sats will be transferred to a new SatsFund.\
\
Following 100% transparency (which is the most important yet equally ignored aspect of web3 nowadays), the community is kept informed by continuously posting performance as well as, disclosing the addresses of all SatsFunds.
