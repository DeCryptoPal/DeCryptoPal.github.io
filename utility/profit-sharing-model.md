# ðŸ’° Profit Sharing Model

The SatsFund is structured in a way that motivates people to HODL our Inscriptions. As previously stated, the returns from our investments are returned to these inscription holders directly in sats. \
\
_<mark style="color:blue;">**The sats distribution process is outlined below:**</mark>_

* The profit earned from the SatsFund (the remaining balance minus the initial balance)
* 50% of the initial balance in the SatsFund
* The remaining balance will be transferred to a new SatsFund

Moreover with our "Guaranteed Buyback Program" , the repurchased Inscriptions will be resold via auction to boost the SatsFund, thereby raising the profits in sats for other HODLers. This provides a unique incentive to buy and hold the Inscription for an outstanding passive income in the bull market, in SATS.

_<mark style="color:blue;">In the event that the SatsFund closes with a loss, only 50% of the remaining balance will be used for distribution, while the rest 50% will remain for future SatsFunds.</mark>_
