# ðŸš€ AI-driven Investments

<mark style="color:blue;">**SatsMachine:**</mark> We are creating a deep neural network (DNN) model that utilizes reinforcement learning algorithms. This model is being rigorously trained on large datasets of past data to make predictions and provide investment recommendations based on market trends and patterns. It also incorporates sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques to gather insights from web and social media platforms like Twitter to make more informed investment decisions. This model would continuously learn and adapt to the changing market conditions, providing real-time recommendations for optimal investment strategies.

<mark style="color:blue;">**SatsView:**</mark> This model will be used to analyze market sentiment by analyzing the tone of news articles, social media posts, and other sources of information related to a particular collection. This information can be used to make informed investment decisions based on market sentiment.

## Investment Decisions

We have a three step process:\
****\
****<mark style="color:blue;">**1. Selecting Micro Fund Investment Focus**</mark>\
****Our project uses AI in the selection of investment preferences for each Micro Fund. Once a Micro SatsFund has raised 5 BTC, our SatsView model is used to determine its investment focus.\
\
****<mark style="color:blue;">**2. Choosing Investments**</mark>\
****After considering both the recommendations of the developer and the opinions of the community, we have narrowed down our choices for new and existing investment collections. At this point, we turn to our SatsMachine model to get its results on whether we should proceed with investing in these projects.\
\
****<mark style="color:blue;">**3. Choosing When to Sell**</mark>\
****One of the most challenging aspects of investing is determining when it is appropriate to sell. To make this decision, we utilize crowdsource intelligence by utilizing our network. Every week, we can vote on which investments we should sell based on their change in value since we made the investment.\
\
<mark style="color:green;">With each SatsFund, our community holds the power of a Veto. This means that our community has the ability to initiate a vote to override decision regarding investment in a particular collection.</mark>
