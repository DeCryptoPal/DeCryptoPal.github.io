# ðŸ–Œ AI-SatsFund

## Welcome degens!

AI-SatsFund is a decentralized venture capital fund powered by blockchain and AI, specifically created for the bitcoin ecosystem. \
\
The team generates revenue through fees which is then deposited in a Treasury Wallet. The funds are then invested in various new and existing projects through SatsFunds with different investment objectives ranging from utility-focused to meme-focused projects.&#x20;

The fund is designed to be accessible to a wide range of investors, regardless of their level of experience or expertise. Investors can participate in the fund by purchasing Bitcoin Inscriptions, which represent a share in the fund's portfolio, there by making them decentralized fractionalized Owners of SatsCapital. \
\
Inscriptions can be bought and sold on various upcoming marketplaces like Ordinals Wallet etc., allowing investors to easily buy in and cash out of the fund, thereby adhering to the web3 ethos. There will also be "Guaranteed Buyback Policy" implemented below a certain threshold, to shield our investors and build trust within the ecosystem.\
